    Laura is a meticulous and detail oriented engineer who will complement and improve any complex integration, data analysis, or product launch project. Her intellectual curiosity, focus on the customer, willingness to build connections and challenge assumptions, and drive to improve and document processes were critical to multiple projects during the time we worked together at Opower.
    Her work was instrumental to simplifying and improving an integration with a demanding client with complex data. This resulted in an improved client relationship, fewer operational issues for Opower and the client, willingness of the client to increase their engagement.
    During a new product launch she engaged and collaborated with the development team, identified gaps between the product and client capabilities, designed and implemented a workaround which allowed the product to launch on time with good quality.

  excerpt: She not only demands excellence, when she sees an area to improve or fix, she seizes it and delivers. Laura would be an asset to any team.
  full_review: I had the pleasure of working with Laura at Opower for two years, managing her directly for one of those. During that time Laura collaborated with on our our development teams to deliver a new product. She questioned their assumptions, and when she found a gap in the product, designed and developed a workaround. We were able to deliver this product to our client on time, and her solution worked perfectly, without any bugs, for the months needed to deliver a product enhancement. She not only demands excellence, when she sees an area to improve or fix, she seizes it and delivers. Laura would be an asset to any team.
